## RFC-DRE — Commercial Boundary Canon (Hard Cut)

Status: CANONICAL / NON-NEGOTIABLE  
Author: Chulhee Park  
Scope: RFC-DRE Lite (All public-facing exposure)

---

## WHAT RFC-DRE IS (AND ONLY THIS)

RFC-DRE is a **research-grade diagnostic engine**.

It exists to:
- measure coherence damage
- expose failure limits
- audit illusion after collapse

It does **not** create capability.  
It does **not** restore intelligence.  
It does **not** promise continuity.

---

## WHAT RFC-DRE IS NOT (ABSOLUTE)

RFC-DRE is NOT:

- a product
- an SDK for production
- an AGI component
- a memory system
- a personalization engine
- a chatbot feature
- a platform
- a solution

Any claim implying otherwise is **invalid**.

---

## FORBIDDEN CLAIMS (ZERO TOLERANCE)

The following claims are prohibited:

- performance superiority
- benchmark comparison
- “solves coherence”
- “fixes identity”
- “persistent intelligence”
- “ready for deployment”
- “commercially available”

RFC-DRE does not fix failure.  
RFC-DRE measures failure.

---

## PERMITTED USE (ONLY)

RFC-DRE may be exposed only as:

- falsification demo
- failure analysis tool
- research diagnostic
- architectural probe
- pre-commercial R&D artifact

If falsifiability is removed, usage is invalid.

---

## DEPENDENCY RULE (UNBREAKABLE)

RFC-DRE depends on RCIRCUIT.

- RCIRCUIT defines cause
- RFC-DRE observes consequence

If RCIRCUIT is falsified:
- RFC-DRE is void
- all downstream interpretation collapses

---

## COMMERCIAL HARD LINE

RFC-DRE may only be licensed as:

- diagnostic tooling
- evaluation framework
- failure audit engine

It may NEVER be sold as:
- capability
- intelligence
- end-user product

---

## FINAL ENFORCEMENT

> The moment RFC-DRE promises success,  
> it becomes non-canonical.

This document overrides README, slides, talks, threads, and hype.

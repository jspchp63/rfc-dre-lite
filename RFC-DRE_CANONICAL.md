## 0. Canonical Declaration

This document is the **single source of truth** for RFC-DRE.

- README files may summarize.
- Experiments may evolve.
- Implementations may change.

**This document does not.**

If any description conflicts with this file,
**this file overrides all others**.

---

## 1. What RFC-DRE Is (Exact Definition)

RFC-DRE (Decision & Resonance Engine) is a **software-level engine**
that evaluates, stabilizes, and returns **coherence under disruption**.

It does **not** create coherence.
It does **not** compute intelligence.
It does **not** replace RCIRCUIT.

RFC-DRE measures and manages **damage** after coherence loss.

---

## 2. Foundational Assumption (Non-Negotiable)

RFC-DRE assumes the following statement is already true:

> **Coherence collapses structurally due to transport, synchronization,
> and state replay — not due to insufficient computation.**

This assumption is **proven or falsified only by RCIRCUIT**.

If RCIRCUIT is falsified,
RFC-DRE is invalid by definition.

---

## 3. Position in the Architecture Stack

RFC-DRE exists strictly **above** RCIRCUIT.

| Layer | Role |
|---|---|
| Physical | Energy, heat, interconnect, timing |
| RCIRCUIT | Phase-based coherence propagation |
| **RFC-DRE** | Coherence evaluation & return |
| HROS | Human-facing intent & meaning |

RFC-DRE **never replaces** RCIRCUIT.
It reacts to outcomes RCIRCUIT reveals.

---
## Cross-Reference Authority Rules

This document is canonically bound with:

- **RCIRCUIT_CANONICAL.md**
- **RFC-DRE_CANONICAL.md**

The following authority rules are absolute:

### Rule 1 — Causality Order
RCIRCUIT defines **structural cause**.  
RFC-DRE defines **observed consequence**.

> Cause always overrides consequence.

If RFC-DRE observations contradict RCIRCUIT results,  
RFC-DRE is invalid until RCIRCUIT is falsified.

---

### Rule 2 — Failure Propagation
If RCIRCUIT is falsified:
- All RFC-DRE claims collapse
- All HROS-layer interpretations collapse
- All downstream applications are void

If RFC-DRE is falsified:
- RCIRCUIT remains valid
- Measurement strategy must be revised

---

### Rule 3 — No Upward Dependency
RCIRCUIT **must not** depend on:
- RFC-DRE metrics
- HROS narratives
- Human-centered interpretation

Any reference implying upward dependency is incorrect.

---

### Rule 4 — Repository Authority
Executable truth lives in:
- `rcircuit-phase-engine`

Interpretive and measurement logic lives in:
- `rfc-dre-lite`

Documentation and physics framing live in:
- `HROS-RCIRCUIT-LAB`

No repository may override another outside this hierarchy.

---

### Rule 5 — External Communication Constraint
Public claims must follow this order:

RCIRCUIT (structure)  
→ RFC-DRE (measurement)  
→ HROS (human meaning)

Any public statement reversing this order is non-canonical.

---

### Rule 6 — Chat Is Not Canon
Chat logs, threads, or conversations:
- do not define truth
- do not override canonical files
- exist only to generate canonical text

Only committed canonical files define system reality.

---

### Rule 7 — Amendment Rule
Canonical files may only be modified when:
1. New executable evidence exists, or
2. A falsification is demonstrated

Narrative, popularity, or confusion are not valid reasons.


## 4. Problem RFC-DRE Addresses

After coherence collapses:

- sessions fragment
- identity drifts
- replay accumulates noise
- meaning diverges

Most systems attempt recovery via:
- replay
- synchronization
- aggregation

RFC-DRE treats this as a **structural error**, not an optimization issue.

---

## 5. Core Question RFC-DRE Tests

> **Given irreversible coherence loss,
> how much continuity can be reconstructed at all?**

Not “how to fix it”.
Not “how to hide it”.
Only **how much survives**.

---

## 6. RFC-DRE Operating Principle

RFC-DRE compares two classes of behavior:

### A. Transport Replay (Baseline Failure Mode)

- State serialization
- Session replay
- Noise accumulation
- Drift amplification

### B. Resonance-Based Reconstruction (Test Path)

- No full state transport
- Local pattern re-alignment
- Partial phase recovery
- Bounded continuity

RFC-DRE does **not** claim superiority.
It measures divergence.

---

## 7. Canonical Metrics (Defined, Not Marketed)

These metrics exist **only for comparison**:

- **CI — Coherence Index**
- **POR — Pattern Overlap Ratio**
- **ΔR — Drift vs Recovery Delta**

They are **diagnostic**, not performance metrics.

No benchmark claims are permitted.

---

## 8. What RFC-DRE Is NOT (Explicit)

RFC-DRE is:

- ❌ Not an AGI component
- ❌ Not an optimizer
- ❌ Not a memory system
- ❌ Not a prompt framework
- ❌ Not a UX feature
- ❌ Not a product today

Any description claiming otherwise is incorrect.

---

## 9. Relationship to Existing Repositories

| Repository | Role |
|---|---|
| rcircuit-phase-engine | Executable proof of coherence collapse |
| HROS-RCIRCUIT-LAB | Architecture, physics, documentation |
| **RFC-DRE Lite** | Preparation space (non-executable) |
| **RFC-DRE_CANONICAL.md** | This file — authority |

RFC-DRE Lite exists **only** to eventually implement
what is defined here.

---

## 10. Current Development Status (Truth)

- Logical definition: **Complete**
- Architectural position: **Fixed**
- Metrics definition: **Complete**
- Executable demo: **Not yet implemented**
- Commercial readiness: **No**

This status must not be overstated.

---

## 11. Conditions for Implementation

RFC-DRE implementation may proceed **only if**:

1. RCIRCUIT results remain unfalsified
2. Reconstruction failure modes are testable
3. The demo can fail cleanly and visibly

If these are not met, **implementation must stop**.

---

## 12. Commercial Boundary (Hard Line)

RFC-DRE may become a product **only as**:

- Diagnostic engine
- Failure analysis tool
- Coherence damage auditor

It is **not** a core compute product.

Any commercialization must preserve falsifiability.

---

## 13. Canonical Closing Statement

> **RFC-DRE does not promise continuity.  
> It measures how much continuity was lost —  
> and how much illusion remains.**

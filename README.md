# RFC-DRE Lite — Coherence Reconstruction Demo (Alpha)

> **Executable falsification demo**  
> Transport-style replay vs resonance-based reconstruction  
> Minimal by design. Uncomfortable by intent.

## ONE QUESTION (READ THIS FIRST)

This repository asks **one falsifiable question**:

**Does coherence across sessions fail because of insufficient intelligence,  
or because meaning is transported and reconstructed instead of locally re-evolved?**

**Claim (to be falsified):**  
Transport-style replay degrades long-term coherence under noise.  
Local resonance-based reconstruction preserves coherence longer.

This repository exists **only** to test that claim.

---

## WHAT THIS IS

RFC-DRE Lite is a **minimal executable demo** that compares two strategies:

1. **Transport Replay**
   - Session breaks
   - State is replayed / reconstructed
   - Noise accumulates
   - Coherence decays

2. **Resonance Reconstruction**
   - No state transport
   - Local phase evolution
   - Coherence re-emerges under noise

This is **not** a product, SDK, benchmark, or feature showcase.  
It is a **structural falsification probe**.

## WHAT THIS IS NOT

- ❌ Not HROS (conceptual OS layer)
- ❌ Not RCIRCUIT (transport-free compute engine)
- ❌ Not AGI
- ❌ Not a chatbot feature
- ❌ Not UX polish
- ❌ Not SOTA benchmarking

If you are looking for features or performance numbers — **stop here**.

## QUICK START (COPY–PASTE)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/rfc-dre-lite.git
cd rfc-dre-lite
python demo/demo_coherence_reconstruction.py
## Expected Output

- Coherence score
- Baseline vs reconstructed divergence
- Simple plot or printed metric

---

## Metrics (Visible, Not Claimed)

These metrics are **illustrative**, not benchmarks.

- **Coherence Index (CI)**
- **Pattern Overlap Ratio (POR)**
- **Drift vs Recovery Delta**

---

## Relation to RCIRCUIT

- **RCIRCUIT**: transport-free phase compute (theory + simulation)
- **RFC-DRE Lite**: coherence reconstruction demo (software-level)

RFC-DRE Lite does **not** prove RCIRCUIT.  
It demonstrates a **compatible failure–recovery principle**.

---

## Why This Matters

Modern AI systems fail coherence because:

- Context is **moved**
- State is **serialized**
- Meaning is **reconstructed via transport**

This demo shows a **different direction**:  
coherence via **local pattern resonance**, not recall.

## READ THIS FIRST — ONE QUESTION

Most AI systems don’t lose coherence because they are dumb.  
They lose coherence because **meaning is transported, replayed, and synchronized**.

This repository asks **one falsifiable question**:

**Does cross-session coherence fail because intelligence is insufficient,  
or because meaning is reconstructed via transport instead of locally re-evolving?**

---

## CLAIM (TO BE FALSIFIED)

- Transport-style replay degrades long-horizon coherence under noise.
- Local resonance-based reconstruction preserves coherence longer.

If this claim is wrong, **this repository should fail**.

---

## WHAT THIS IS (NO BS)

RFC-DRE Lite is a **minimal executable research demo** comparing two strategies:

### 1. Transport Replay
- session breaks
- state serialization / replay
- noise accumulation
- coherence drift

### 2. Resonance Reconstruction
- no global state transport
- local phase / pattern re-alignment
- partial coherence re-emergence under noise

This is **not** a product.  
This is **not** prompt engineering.  
This is a **controlled probe into system failure and partial recovery**.

---

## WHAT THIS IS NOT

- ❌ Not HROS (conceptual OS layer)
- ❌ Not RCIRCUIT (transport-free compute engine)
- ❌ Not AGI
- ❌ Not a chatbot feature
- ❌ Not UX polish
- ❌ Not SOTA benchmarking

If you want features, metrics, or demos to impress management — stop here.

## QUICK START (COPY–PASTE)

git clone https://github.com/jspchp63/rfc-dre-lite.git

cd rfc-dre-lite
python demo/demo_coherence_reconstruction.py
---

## EXPECTED OUTPUT

- Coherence score
- Replay vs reconstruction divergence
- Simple plot or printed metric

These are **visible signals**, not benchmark claims.

---

## METRICS (ILLUSTRATIVE)

- Coherence Index (CI)
- Pattern Overlap Ratio (POR)
- Drift vs Recovery Delta

Numbers exist to **compare failure modes**, not to sell performance.

---

## RELATION TO RCIRCUIT (IMPORTANT)

- **RCIRCUIT** explains *why coherence collapses structurally*
- **RFC-DRE Lite** probes *how much continuity can be recovered anyway*

RFC-DRE Lite **assumes** the coherence failure demonstrated in RCIRCUIT.  
If RCIRCUIT is wrong, this project should collapse.

That dependency is intentional.

---

## WHY THIS MATTERS (IF YOU BUILD SYSTEMS)

If you work on:
- long-running agents
- multi-session assistants
- AI counseling / dialogue systems
- autonomous workflows
- identity-persistent AI

You are already fighting this problem —  
whether your roadmap admits it or not.

RFC-DRE Lite does not fix it.  
It measures **how bad the damage is** and **how much can be recovered**.

---

## STATUS

- research demo
- alpha quality
- single-file runnable
- unstable metrics
- no guarantees
- no promises

If you need certainty, don’t run this.

## FINAL FENCE

> **If your system depends on coherence  
and you are not testing how it fails,  
you are shipping a lie.**
